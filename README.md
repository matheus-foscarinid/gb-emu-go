# 🕹️ GB Emulator (name TBD)

A Game Boy emulator written in Go. The goal is simple: build a fully working GB emulator from scratch and play some classic games on it, just because it's cool.

It doesn't have a name yet — suggestions are welcome.

The author has zero experience in low-level programming and is learning a lot about CPU architecture, memory management, and hardware emulation while building this emulator.
